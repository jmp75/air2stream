The Python package **uchronia** is the python interface to a C++ library designed to handle multidimensional time series and ensemble thereof.

[Uchronia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uchronia) is a literary neologism for a hypothetical or fictional time-period of our world. This seems a suitable name for a library primarily designed notably to handle ensemble forecast time series.
